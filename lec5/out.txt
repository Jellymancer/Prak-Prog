Testing _aloc, _set, _get and _print.
Allocating a vector of size 4:
Allocation sucessfull. All elements are now set to 1.
Checking if the values of the vector equal one after runnig _set by using _get.
Value at index i=0 is equal to 1
Value at index i=1 is equal to 1
Value at index i=2 is equal to 1
Value at index i=3 is equal to 1

Now testing the print function which should return the same vector of ones.
v=
1
1
1
1


Testing _set_zero by allocating new vector and checking if all entries are zero.
v=
0
0
0
0


Now I define two vectors, a and b:
a=
4
2
2
2

b=
1
2
1
2

Using _add and _sub to subtract and add the vectors yields:
a+b=
5
4
3
4

a-b=
3
0
1
0


 Defining x=5 and checking b*x:
x*b=
5
10
5
10
