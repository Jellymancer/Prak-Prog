Function f(x)=sin(0.5*x) is tabluated in discrete steps.The linear and quadratic splines of f(x) are shown in figure 1
Calculating the linear spline integral of the cosine function from 0 to x=5 yields a value of I_lin=3.22769.
Analytic integration of the integral gives I_ana=3.60229
The same integral cacculated using the quadratic spline yields I_quad = 3.60571
The derivative of the quadratic spline is shown together with the analytic derivative f'(x)=0.5*cos(0.5*x) in figure 2
