Function f(x)=sin(0.5*x) and the linear and quadratic spline are shown in figure 1
Calculating the and spline integral of the cosine function from 0 to x=5 yields a value of I_lin=3.22769.
Manual integration of the function gives I_man=3.60229
The same integral performed using the quadratic spline yields I_quad = 2.27946e+07
The integral of the quadratic spline is shown together with the analytic integral in figure 2
