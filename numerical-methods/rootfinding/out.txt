Finding the extremum of the Rosenbrock's function:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
 -2.000
  8.000

And the value of the derivatives at the start Df=[dfdx,dfdy]:
3194.000
800.000

The minimum is found at [x,y]:
  0.968
  0.938

Using the newton algorythm using a maunually supplied analytical jacobian gives a minimum at [x,y]:
  1.000
  0.999
