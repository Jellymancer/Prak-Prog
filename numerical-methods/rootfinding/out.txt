Finding the extremum of the Rosenbrock's function:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
  2.000
  2.000
The minimum is found at [x,y]:
  1.000
  1.000
The number of function calls is 112
Inserting the found values of x and y into Rosenbrocks' function yields (Should be zero):
  0.000
 -0.000

Using the newton algorythm with a maunually supplied analytical jacobian gives a minimum at [x,y]:
  1.000
  1.000
The number of function calls is 85
GSL hybrids rootfinder takes 3 steps before finding the root.



Root finding for the system of equations given in assignment A:

 20.000
Solution v=[x,y]:
  0.000
  9.106
The number of function calls is 38
Putting the found values of x and y into the system of equations gives (Should be zero):
 -0.000
  0.000

Using the newton algorythm using a maunually supplied analytical jacobian gives a minimum at [x,y]:
  0.000
  9.106
The number of function calls is 19
GSL hybrids rootfinder takes 137 steps before finding the root.
