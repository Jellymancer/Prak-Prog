Assignment A: finding minima of Rosenbrockss' and Himmelblaus' functions using newtons method.
Finding the minimum of Rosenbrocks' function:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
  1.500
  3.000

The minimum is found at [x_min,y_min]:
  1.000
  1.000
The function value at this point is f(x_min,y_min)=2.90762e-12

It took 70 steps to find the minimum


Finding one of the minima of Himmelblaus' function:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
  4.000
  3.000

The minimum is found at [x_min,y_min]:
  3.000
  2.000
The function value at this point is f(x_min,y_min)=3.22237e-10

It took 20 steps to find the minimum


Assignment B: Broyden update.
Trying the same two function using quasi-newtion with Broyden update.
Finding the minimum of Rosenbrocks' function using broyden:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
  1.500
  3.000

The minimum is found at [x,y]:
  1.000
  1.000
The function value at this point is f(x_min,y_min)=1.39176e-13

It took 507 steps to find the minimum


Finding one of the minima of Himmelblaus' function using broyden update:
initial guess v=[x,y]:
  3.500
  1.000

The minimum is found at [x_min,y_min]:
  3.000
  2.000
The function value at this point is f(x_min,y_min)=1.2091e-12

It took 58 steps to find the minimum


Radioactive decay.
Now I make a fit to the radioactive data (listed in exp.dat) using least squares.

The parameters of the best fit are found to be: [A,T,B]:
  3.557
  3.205
  1.232
The data points together with the best fit can be seen in figure 1.
