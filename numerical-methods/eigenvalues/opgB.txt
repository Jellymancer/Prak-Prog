Assigment B1:
Jacobi eigenvalue algorythm implementation lowest eigenvalue only.

Matrix A from assignment A is used here, which means that the eigenvalues found here should correspond to the ones foudn in the previous assignment.

Running the jacobi diagonalization algorythm for the first row only: 
The lowest eigenvalue is: l=-0.2744:

 Assignment B2: The algorythm can be set up to give the highest eigenvalue first, then the second highest etc. by changing the sign of the rotation angle.
The highest eigenvalue is: l= 2.0241

Assignment B3: The number of sweeps required for the diagonalization of the entire matrix by the cyclic method is 5 compared to 6sweeps required to find the lowest eigenvalue only

Assignment B4: The number of sweeps required to diagonilize the matix eigenvalue using the two methods is shown in the attached figure
