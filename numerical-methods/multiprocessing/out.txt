Multiprocessing will be used to run the adaptive integrator. Two threads are made, one for assignment A and the other for assignment B.
1:Assignment A: Recursive adaptive integration. Integrating the given four function and comparing the result to the listed value.

1:Numerical integration of sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 yields:  I=0.666663. It should be 2/3.
1:No. of evaluations: N=373

1:Numerical integration of sqrt(x)⁻¹ from 0 to 1 yields:  I=2.00008. It should be 2.
1:No. of evaluations: N=1433

2:

Assigment B: Infinite integrals.
The used routines are compared to the results of GSL routines.
2:Numerical integration of exp(-x²) from -Inf to Inf.
 I=1.77248. I_GSL= 1.77245.
2:No. of evaluations: 861

2:Numerical integration of 1/x² from 5 to Inf yields.
 I=0.200022. I_GSL= 0.2.
2:No. of evaluations: N=1148

Thread 2 closed.
1:Numerical integration of ln(x)/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 yields: I= -4.00011. It should be -4.
1:No. of evaluations: N=3939

1:Numerical integration of 4*sqrt(1-(1-x)²) from 0 to 1 yields: I=3.14158. It should be 3.14159.
1:No. of evaluations: N=4581

Thread 1 closed.
