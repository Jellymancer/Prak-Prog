Assignment 1: ODE using Runge-Kutta midpoint method
Testing the algorythm on a simple differential equation: dy/dx = 3x+4 which has an analytic solution y= 3/2 x² + 4x + c.
Setting startpoint x=-50 and dydx=3/2*50²-200 so that c=0.
I also set the end point to be x_end = 50. The analytical solution at this point gives y(50)=3950.
The obtained numerical solution is: y(50)=3950.000000.
The number of iterations made is: 2078


Assignment 2: Storing the path.
 Using the same function, the algorythm is performed again, this time the points calcutated along the way to x=50 are stored.
The numerical and analytical solutions are shown in figure 1
The numerical solution alone is plotted in figure 2 using a lower initial step size and tolerances. It can be seem that steps become denser close to 0 where the derivative changes rapidly.

Now I solve the differential equation d²y/dx² -xy = 0. The solution to this equation are the airy functions.
The equation is split into dy1/dx=y2 and dy2/dx =xy1
Two functions solve this equations the Ai and Bi airy functions.
I use the Bi starting values (from wikipedia) so the program should find Bi. The numeric solution is plotted together with the Bi from GSL in figure 3
